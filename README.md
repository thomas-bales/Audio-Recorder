# Audio Recorder
 This program will write output audio from Windows computers to a WAV file.
 
 This project was originally part of a much larger spectral analyzer project. Unfortunately, building a spectral analyzer requires much more than I had originally thought. In order to display graphics, I would need to learn OpenGL, in order to display frequencies, I would need to learn how to implement the Fast Fourier Transform, or at least a library that could implement the Fast Fourier Transform for me. I did learn the basics of both of these, however, I found I needed a much more in depth understanding of OpenGL and the Fast Fourier Transform in order to implement them properly, something I do not have the time for currently as I am invested in learning web development. However, building this project taught me a lot about how audio is represented digitally, how WAV files are structure and how binary files are represented, and how the Microsoft Core Audio APIs are structured. Perhaps in the future, I will revisit this project, mayber after learning an audio framework like JUCE.
